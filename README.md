# 1.Introduction
In Yu-gi-oh Master Duel all your cards/sleeves/terrain/summon animation can be overridden on your local machine.
Because the changes only happens locally and you don't get an advantage by changing the resources I don't see why Konami would care. 

# 2.Tools
1. PC Steam version of Master Duel
2. AssetStudio.net6 - this requires .Net framework v6.x.x
3. UABEA
4. Image Editor(GIMP is OK)
5. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IXpwCaabi47Ly8dAf4aJtFdYwi29yGkCJ4bvMhnsvc8/edit#gid=1574353405">Spreadsheet</a> with every card artwork, sleeve/protector, wallpaper.

## NOTE
I added AssetStudio.net6 and UABEA to this repository. You can also find them on github.
